# UI Guide

A [small documentation site](https://citizennet.github.io/purescript-cn-ui/) using our custom CSS and components. This site has a number of goals, including to provide a place to:

- Load our various components in one place for easy, isolated testing -- including by the product and business teams
- Access quick visual feedback when developing components or CSS, before pushing to Wildcat
- Demonstrate various configurations for complex components
- Try out new ideas in minimal environments without fighting with the context of larger systems like Wildcat

Most CSS and PureScript should already have been written in the CSS, Components, and Blocks folders. This project may augment with additional HTML and CSS, but only minimally, and as necessary to provide scaffolding around our otherwise pre-made styles and components.

Some inspiration for the structure of this site came from [purescript-halogen-storybook](https://github.com/rnons/purescript-halogen-storybook).
