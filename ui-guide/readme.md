# UI Guide

A [small documentation site](https://citizennet.github.io/purescript-cn-ui/) using our custom CSS and components. This site has a number of goals, including to provide a place to:

- Load our various components in one place for easy, isolated testing -- including by the product and business teams
- Access quick visual feedback when developing components or CSS, before pushing to Wildcat
- Demonstrate various configurations for complex components
- Try out new ideas in minimal environments without fighting with the context of larger systems like Wildcat
